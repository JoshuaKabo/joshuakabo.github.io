[$] Test code snippet with gdsl
    glsl should do the trick for now
    (the alternatives are too much work, idk how to use the gdscript one, and making my own would be way too much)
[] Get code snippet working with code file input
[] Put together a paper draft of what I want
    [] tabs?
    [] layout
[] Make code snippet into a more attractive and functional window (polish step 1)
[opt] Use Github API to pull latest state of code files for demos
    - may be overly complicated
